Dependecy injection- Setter based and construtor based injection,inject any bin in any container in the spring, use ioc container uses dependecy injection
Autowiring- It will detect automatically bin and inject bins automatically
what are bin oops we have? 
Singlton prototypes bin
Bin factory- Application context and basic container
Application context explain,
what are rest API annotation- @restController,@produce,@queryParamter,@Consume,PathParameter
What is @ResponseBody annotation
if want to get response in XML?
what is @SpringBootApplication?
How it will detect Bin?
how Autoconfiguration works?
what is SpringBoot-Starter-Parent?
what are the advatages of using starter?
what is actuator?
what are matrix, I can check?
how will you connect database-Hibernate, JDBC
Use SQL Query to execute in SpringBoot in reposatory using Hibernate
Spring Data JPA??
MicroService Architecture??
Spring Cloud Component??
Serilization in java??
HashCode Collision in HashMap??
What is static?
What is unique about String?
Create class immutable?
How often Heap memory get to grabage collected?
String Builder and String Buffer
what are different type of Exception that you have hadle and explain in details?
can we handle unchecked exception, is it a good practice?
e.printStackTrace
Log a exception or any message 
how do I use Logger?
what about appender in Log4j?
how do I serilize any object in java?API or Service to Serilization
Marker interface?
What are annotations? annotations are nothing but classes, can we make own annotation
Factory design pattern??use mediatype JSON and create new class to read JSON
understand third party objects?? Adapter pattern??
Singloton class??
Strategy pattern??
versioning of web services end points??
String constant pool?
String immutable advantage- we can create a large number of reference that will refer to same objects, not create new objects in constant pool,helps in memory optimization
what are streamAPI's??
ArrayList v/s LinkedList
HashMap V/s Concurrent HashMap
HashMap working internally??
Customize Exception??
Exception Propogation?
@Component and @ComponentScan annotation?
Autowiring for same bin?
@Qualifier annotation?
@Consume
How to secure REST Api?
@pathvariable and @RequestParameter

What is the default value of the local variables?
The local variables are not initialized to any default value, neither primitives nor object references.

-> IoC is also known as dependency injection (DI)
-> Spring beans are just instance objects that are managed by the Spring container, namely, they are created and wired by the framework and put into a "bag of objects" (the 	container) from where you can get them later.The "wiring" part there is what dependency injection is all about, what it means is that you can just say "I will need this thing" and the framework will follow some rules to get you the proper instance.
-> In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container
-> Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991. It can also be known as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.

Default Constructor: default constructor is the one which does not accept any value. The default constructor is mainly used to initialize the instance variable with the default values. It can also be used for performing some useful task on object creation. A default constructor is invoked implicitly by the compiler if there is no constructor defined in the class.
Parameterized Constructor: The parameterized constructor is the one which can initialize the instance variables with the given values. In other words, we can say that the constructors which can accept the arguments are called parameterized constructors.


Ques- Does constructor return any value?
Ans: yes, The constructor implicitly returns the current instance of the class (You can't use an explicit return type with the constructor)
Ques- Is constructor inherited?
ANs: No, The constructor is not inherited.
Ques- Can you make a constructor final?
Ans- No, the constructor can't be final.
Ques- Can we overload the constructors?
Ans- Yes, the constructors can be overloaded by changing the number of arguments accepted by the constructor or by changing the data type of the parameters. 

What are the differences between the constructors and methods?
